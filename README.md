# Gravity Forms: Image Select field

A custom field for Gravity Forms that allows an image selection (and cropping) from the local media library.

Uses [cropperjs](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropperjs).

## Usage:

This is a field for (front-end) form submission image selection, not (back-end) field image selection. The "Select image" button is only enabled on the front-end.

1. Make a page.
2. Include the form.
3. Ensure there are images in your media library.
4. Load the page.
5. Select an image.
6. Optionally crop it.
7. Optionally preview it.
8. Submit the form.
9. Review the newly submitted form entry.

## Disclamer:

It is **not** battle tested, so use with care.
